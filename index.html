    <p>Mrs. Amabelle is someone who got pure innocent heart, she's beautiful inside and outside.</p>
    <p>She hold me tight and shower me with her love. She's a definition of perfection, I've never seen gorgeous woman as her. I'm grateful for her love, it is truly touching and I wish I could show my appreciation in this way.</p>
    <p>I know that I could never repay her love for me, no matter how much money I had, how much energy I had. I will spend my lifetime cherishing and loving Mrs. Amabelle, until the end of time, eventhough we're not together for now on. But hereby, I wrote this book with hope that can fix our relationship. Before she came to my life, I felt like I was missing something, I was misery. Since we met, my life has been completely different. She is just like a flower with many different fragrances. Thank you for adding color to my life with the love in your heart, sorry for being late to realize it. I know that you really care about me, about our relationship, but I'm so stupid that I'm late to realize how much you love me.</p>
    <p>I'm sorry for everything, sorry if I'm not being good enough. But I promise I will try more more more and more from now on, I prove it in this gift that I made for you.</p>

    <p>I find solace in the tranquility of silence over the desolation that stems from being misconstrued.</p>
    <p>I was born in the family that don't know any small detail about me, never said they were proud of me, never been there for me when I'm at my lowest. I've never been comfortable in my own home. Each day passes without a single inquiry into my well-being, leaving my wounds unattended. The fear of expressing myself has driven me to embrace the silence of my misunderstood sadness. I swear, it's really hard when your chest is so heavy and your head is full of questions, but all you can do is pretend that everything was fine, I don't want to burden you. I have always been hesitant to confide in you, resulting in further harm to our relationship. I sincerely apologize for my actions and am determined to evolve into a better version of myself, both for your sake and for the future we envision together. Just because I'm not showing love the way you want, doesn't mean that I love you any less Mrs. Amabelle. </p>
    <p>You constantly grant me pleasure that I didn't even think would happen in my life. Like the flare in the daybreak, you always start everything beautifully and end it serenely. You eternally wrap me in a wonderfully soothing warmth, you are there when I look for the existence of a shoulder to lean on, and you always give me beautiful affirmations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
    <p>If only you could comprehend the extent of your magnificence and the depth of my love for you. I hold in high regard the way you navigate through life; every aspect of your being is etched in my mind, and with a tranquil heart, I eagerly listen as you share the events that have shaped your existence.</p>
    <p>The mere sound of your voice, the sight of your countenance, the written words you send, and our late-night conversations bring forth a smile so pure. It is as if I am a barren tree, and you, in your embrace, shield me from all apprehension and insecurity. You possess an innate understanding of my needs, without me having to express them beforehand. You are the most celestial chapter of my life this year, and I am filled with immense gratitude to have crossed paths with you, the remarkable individual who effortlessly captured my heart. Like one of my favorite song, 'You keep me warm when the morning comes, keep me close when I feel so numb, hug me tight when the lights are off, I feel happy when you smile, love. I love every little thing you do, give me cuddles when I'm feeling blue, like you;re the answer in every clue, and you keep telling that you love me too.'</p>
  </div>
  <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 6)">
    <p>I can never get over you, I still find myself reading our old conversations. And I thought to myself that it would've been nice if we could last forever. But just in case you decide to comeback, my arms are always open to you. For now, I'll wait for you here. Until now I still haven't deleted our memories; our photos, our messages, your cute voice notes, your cute face when you smile that you sent to me. But that only makes me miss you even more, and there is nothing I can do, so I decided to make this gift for you. I'm sorry, it's my fault, what can I do to get back to you?</p>
    <p>Henceforth, I graciously embrace your envy, your endearing and playful youthful emotions and persona, your tendency to overanalyze, your swiftly shifting moods, your apprehensions about trust, your perpetual need for reassurance and royal care. I pledge to cherish every facet of your being, both virtuous and flawed, steadfastly remaining by your side.</p>
    <p>I kindly ask you to reflect upon the initial encounter that brought us together, and recall the joy that radiated from your smile. Transport yourself back to those days when our conversations flowed effortlessly, captivating us both without a hint of monotony. Let us relive the countless sacrifices, shared laughter, shed tears, and moments of pure bliss that shaped our journey. Consider this deeply, for are you truly prepared to sever the ties that bind us?</p>

    <p>It is undoubtedly effortless to surrender, yet it takes great courage to sit down and communicate, to strive together to mend any fractures in our relationship. I implore you, do not abandon our connection just yet, as a part of me will forever remain intertwined with you. Understand that there may be instances where your love for me wanes, and that is inconsequential. We are not infallible beings, but rather authentic, imperfect individuals, just as genuine as the love we share. Therefore, I do not seek for you to perpetually be infatuated with me or blindly endorse every word or action of mine. Instead, I yearn for you to consciously choose me, even in moments of anger, sadness, or weariness. At the end of each day, I desire that you select me, knowing it to be the ultimate decision.</p>
